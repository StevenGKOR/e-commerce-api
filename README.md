The E-Commerce API you have developed appears to be well-organized and secure, using JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB to manage users, products, and orders for an online store. Various security measures such as helmet, cors, rate-limiter, xss, and mongoSanitize packages were employed, along with JWT for registration/login and bcryptjs for password hashing. and Http-status-codes were utilized to provide specificstatus codes for responses based on user requests and outcomes.

The API enables users to view the available products on a store's website, and if they decide to purchase something, they must sign in or connect to an existing account. They can then order products and leave a review, which they can also modify if they so choose. If they attempt to leave a second review, the API will prevent it by sending an Error response to the front-end. Users can also view their registration information, such as email, name, and password, and modify it as necessary. Additionally, users can view and manage their orders, but can only cancel them.

For an administrator, the API provides full access to all user-related functions, including adding, deleting, and updating products, managing orders, and viewing all users' information (excluding passwords).
